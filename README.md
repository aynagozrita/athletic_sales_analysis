### Athletic Sales Data Analysis

This project is designed to analyze and combine two CSV datasets, `athletic_sales_2020.csv` and `athletic_sales_2021.csv`. It leverages the pandas library to process and analyze sales data efficiently.

## Project Objectives

- Load and read two CSV files into Pandas DataFrames.
- Ensure the data integrity by matching column names and data types.
- Combine the data from two separate years into a single DataFrame.
- Perform data cleaning by handling null values and ensuring correct data types.
- Convert date strings to DateTime objects for ease of analysis.

## Results

With the completed data processing, you have a clean and combined DataFrame for further analysis. The data now includes consistent data types, especially for date handling, paving the way for any sales trend analysis or report generation.

## Challenges 
I faced the challenge of verifying that the "invoice_date" columnâ€™s data type had been changed to DateTime.
